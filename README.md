Weatherstack API
Weatherstack is a leading weather data service offering real time, historical, and forecast weather information for millions of locations worldwide through an easy to integrate API 
It provides accurate and reliable data in JSON format, suitable for various applications such as weather forecasting, travel planning, agriculture, and event
management With its scalable and accessible service, Weatherstack is ideal for both small developers and large enterprises requiring comprehensive weather data.

PROBLEM STATEMENT
There is a growing demand for a streamlined and automated system to gather, process, and store daily weather data from multiple cities reliably and efficiently Current methods are often manual, prone to errors, and lack
scalability, leading to inefficiencies in decision making and data analysis This project aims to develop an ETL ( Transform, Load) pipeline using Apache Airflow and Python, integrated with the Weatherstack API, to automate the
retrieval, processing, and storage of accurate weather data, ensuring timely and reliable information for diverse applications.
